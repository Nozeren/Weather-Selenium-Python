# Weather-Selenium-Python
This project was created for fun and to explore automated testing using Selenium WebDriver. It currently includes two test cases that demonstrate the power and versatility of Selenium for web testing.

### Features:

Google Search Test: This test case simulates a user searching on Google and then validates whether the expected search result appears in the search results. It showcases how to interact with search engines using Selenium.

Weather Website Test: Building upon the Google Search test, this test case navigates to a weather website, searches for weather information for a specific city, and verifies the weather data. It demonstrates more complex interactions with a web page, including handling input fields and extracting information.

Key Technologies Used:

 * Selenium WebDriver: Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers, and it's used here to interact with web elements, perform actions, and extract data from web pages.
 * Python: The project is implemented in Python, which provides a versatile and readable scripting language for Selenium automation.
 * Page Objects: Page Object Pattern is employed to enhance code maintainability by encapsulating page-specific interactions and elements in separate classes.
